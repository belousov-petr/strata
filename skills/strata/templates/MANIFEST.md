# MANIFEST — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Open this first.** The project-owned memory contract for every AI tool working in this repo — and the *only* place structure and routing live. Other files (including `memory/MEMORY.md`) index and point; they do not restate this contract.

Initialized {{INIT_DATE}} with [strata](https://github.com/belousov-petr/strata) 0.0.3. Pattern reference: [DESIGN](https://github.com/belousov-petr/strata/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md) · upgrades: [MIGRATIONS](https://github.com/belousov-petr/strata/blob/main/MIGRATIONS.md).

## Invocation — works the same for every tool

This memory is maintained by the **strata** skill; the operations named below (**save**, **load**, **capture**, **init**) are invoked per tool:

- **Claude Code (plugin):** `/strata:save` · `/strata:load` · `/strata:capture`; init via `Skill(name='strata:strata', args='init')`.
- **Codex and other tools:** `Skill(name='strata', args='init')`, `Skill(name='strata', args='capture')`, and the skill's default rule lookup driving the same save/load flow.

The `/strata:save`-style references throughout this file name those operations — a non-Claude agent performs the identical flow through the skill, not by typing a slash command.

## What {{PROJECT_NAME}} is

## Where do I look for X?

| If you need… | Open… |
|---|---|
| What was I doing last session | `memory/project_state.md` |
| Work in flight right now | `issues/ACTIVE.md` |
| What's on the backlog (by area) | `issues/OPEN.md` |
| Deferred work + revive triggers | `issues/PARKED.md` |
| A rule before doing operation X | `memory/MEMORY.md` rules-by-trigger table → `memory/learnings/<slug>.md` |
| Why a decision was made | `docs/decisions/ADR-NNNN-*.md` |
| How a subsystem works | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/<slug>.md` |
| Product requirements | `docs/product/<slug>.md` |
| A stable fact (paths, schemas, APIs) | `docs/reference/<slug>.md` |
| A procedure / runbook / incident pattern | `docs/ops/` |
| Did we send / post / complete X externally | `memory/archive/action_log.md` (grep) |
| Old sessions, closed issues, provenance | `memory/archive/` · `issues/archive/` (grep) |

## The three tiers

| Tier | Where | When loaded |
|---|---|---|
| **Hot** | `memory/` + `issues/ACTIVE.md` | Session start |
| **Warm** | `docs/` + individual `issues/*.md` | On demand, by task |
| **Cold** | `memory/archive/` + `issues/archive/` | Only on explicit history search |

## Routing — where new knowledge goes

| You produced / discovered | Write to | When |
|---|---|---|
| Finding, bug, improvement, debt, task, feature, initiative | `issues/<id>-<slug>.md` (copy `issues/_TEMPLATE.md`), status `open`, full rationale + diagnostics | **Immediately, mid-session; use `/strata:capture`** |
| Deferred work | same file, status `parked` + `revive-when:` | at capture or triage |
| Behavioral lesson (worked or burned you) | `memory/learnings/<slug>.md` (copy `_TEMPLATE.md`) | at `/strata:capture`, `/strata:save`, or immediately if hard-won |
| Shipped decision with rationale | `docs/decisions/ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` (+ source → `memory/archive/source-adr-*`) | at `/strata:save` |
| Product requirement | `docs/product/<slug>.md` | when it exists |
| How a subsystem works | `docs/architecture/<slug>.md` (+ row in `ARCHITECTURE.md`) | when it stabilizes |
| Stable fact | `docs/reference/<slug>.md` | on second lookup |
| Procedure, runbook, incident | `docs/ops/…` | when it changes |
| Session narrative | `memory/project_state.md` (rollover → archive) | at `/strata:save` |
| Completed external action (PR, email, durable URL) | `memory/archive/action_log.md` append | at `/strata:save` |

**Never store:** secret values (env var *names* only); anything derivable from code or `git log`; raw transcripts, stack traces, command dumps — root cause + evidence instead.

## Capture interrupt (`/strata:capture`)

Use this while working when a command fails, an agent retries with a workaround, a brittle environment rule appears, or a finding is too useful to leave in conversation memory. Route closeable work to `issues/`, reusable behavior to `memory/learnings/`, or both. Do not edit generated views during capture; `/strata:save` regenerates them.

## Load order (`/strata:load`)

1. This file
2. `memory/MEMORY.md`
3. `issues/ACTIVE.md`
4. `memory/project_state.md` (current + last completed only)

Then on demand: `issues/OPEN.md` by area · matching `learnings/<slug>.md` at operation time · specific `docs/**` by task · `archive/` only via explicit grep. **Never bulk-load:** learnings, ADRs, individual issues, anything under `archive/`.

## States and types

- **Issue types:** `bug | improvement | debt | task | feature | initiative`
- **Issue statuses:** `open | in-progress | parked | resolved | wont-fix`
- **Severity:** `high | med | low`
- **Learning origin:** `success | failure`

`parked` requires a concrete `revive-when:` trigger. `resolved`/`wont-fix` are terminal → `issues/archive/` at next `/strata:save`. Status changes are frontmatter edits, not file moves.
